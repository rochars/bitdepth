## Install
```
npm install bitdepth
```

## Use
Currently there is **no dithering** when changing the bit depth.

- **16-bit** is always int
- **32-bit** can be int or float
- **64-bit** is always float.

```javascript
const bitDepth = require("bitdepth");

// 8 bit samples
let samples = [0, 255]

// Make'em 32-bit floating point
bitDepth.toBitDepth(samples, "8", "32f");

console.log(samples);
//[-1, 1]
```

## toBitDepth()
```javascript
/**
 * Change the bit depth of the data in a array.
 * The input array is modified in-place.
 * @param {!Array<number>} samples The samples.
 * @param {string} originalBitDepth The original bit depth of the data.
 *      One of "8", "16", "24", "32", "32f", "64"
 * @param {string} targetBitDepth The new bit depth of the data.
 *      One of "8", "16", "24", "32", "32f", "64"
 */
function toBitDepth(samples, originalBitDepth, targetBitDepth) {}
```
